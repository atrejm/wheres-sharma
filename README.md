Originial inspiration was the Where's Waldo assignment from The Odin Project. I wasn't too interested in making this app pretty, rather focusing on the implementation, so I'm sorry for the eyesore.

There are over 800 boulders in the DB, and I'll be adding more as time goes on. If you have a favorite climbing area that isn't here, let me know and I can add it!
